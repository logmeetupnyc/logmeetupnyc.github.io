      photo: "/img/micheal.jpg"
      abstract: "Both the social and natural world are replete with complex structure that often has a probabilistic interpretation. In the former, we may seek to model, for example, the distribution of natural images or language, for which there are copious amounts of real world data. In the latter, we are given the probabilistic rule describing a physical process, but no procedure for generating samples under it necessary to perform simulation. In this talk, I will discuss a generative modeling paradigm based on maps between probability distributions that is applicable to both of these circumstances. I will describe a means for learning these maps in the context of problems in statistical physics, how to impose symmetries on them to facilitate learning, and how to use the resultant generative models in a statistically unbiased fashion. I will then describe a paradigm that unifies flow-based and diffusion based generative models by recasting generative modeling as a problem of regression. I will demonstrate the efficacy of doing this in computer vision problems and end with some future challenges and applications."
      bio: "Michael Albergo is a postdoc at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

      url: ""
      abstract: "Graphs are powerful tools for representing complex real-world relationships, essential for tasks like analyzing social networks or identifying financial trends.  While large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural text reasoning, their application to graphs remains an understudied frontier. To bridge this gap, we need to transform structured graph data into representations LLMs can process. This talk delves into our work on finding the correct graph inductive bias for Graph ML and developing strategies to convert graphs into language-like formats for LLMs. I'll explore our work on “Talking Like a Graph”, and our parameter-efficient method, GraphToken, which learns an encoding function to extend prompts with explicit structured information."

      abstract: "In this talk, He will be discussing the problem of defining generative models on manifolds. Designing a general recipe for training probabilistic models that works immediately on a wide selection of manifolds has been a difficult challenge, with some naive approaches ignoring the topology of the manifold, suffering from algorithmic complexities, or resulting in biased training objectives. He will introduce his recent work on Riemannian Flow Matching (RFM), a simple yet powerful framework for training continuous normalizing flows on manifolds, which bypasses many inherent limitations and offers several advantages over previous approaches: it is simulation-free on simple geometries, does not suffer from scaling difficulties, and its objective is a simple regression with closed-form target vector fields. The key ingredient behind RFM is the construction of a relatively simple premetric for defining target vector fields, which generalizes the existing Euclidean case. To extend to general geometries, we propose the use of spectral decompositions to efficiently compute premetrics on the fly. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on many real-world non-Euclidean datasets, and we demonstrate tractable training on general geometries, including triangular meshes with highly non-trivial curvature and boundaries."

Prediction and Detecting Healthy Brain Aging Trajectories" # Name Surname
      photo: "/img/mengjia.png"
      abstract: "An expansive area of research focuses on discerning patterns of alterations in
functional brain networks from the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, even at the subjective
cognitive decline (SCD) stage. Here, we developed a novel hyperbolic MEG brain network
embedding framework for transforming complex MEG brain networks into lower-dimensional
hyperbolic representations. Using this model, we computed hyperbolic embeddings of the MEG
brain networks of two distinct participant groups: individuals with SCD and healthy controls. We
demonstrated that these embeddings preserve both local and global geometric information,
presenting reduced distortion compared to rival models, even when brain networks are mapped
into low-dimensional spaces. In addition, our findings showed that the hyperbolic embeddings
encompass unique SCD-related information that improves the discriminatory power above and
beyond that of connectivity features alone. Overall,
this study presents the first evaluation of hyperbolic embeddings of MEG brain networks,
offering novel insights into brain organization, cognitive decline, and potential diagnostic
avenues of Alzheimer’s disease."

      photo: "/img/jie.jpg"
      abstract: "The notion of curvature describes how spaces are bent at each point and Ricci flow deforms the space such that curvature changes in a way analogous to the diffusion of heat. In this talk I will discuss some of our work on discrete Ollivier Ricci curvature defined on graphs. Discrete curvature defined on an edge captures the local connectivity in the neighborhood. In general edges within a densely connected community have positive curvature while edges connecting different communities have negative curvature. By deforming edge weights with respect to curvature one can derive a Ricci flow metric which is robust to edge insertion/deletion. I will present applications of graph Ricci flow in graph analysis and learning, including network alignment, community detection and graph neural networks."

    - name: "End-to-end learning geometries for graphs, dynamical systems, and regression" # Name Surname
      photo: "/img/brandon.png"
      abstract: "Every machine learning setting has an underlying geometry where
the data is represented and the predictions are performed in.
While defaulting the geometry to a Euclidean or known manifold is
capable of building powerful models, /learning/ a non-trivial geometry
from data is useful for improving the overall performance and estimating
unobserved structures.
This talk focuses on learning geometries for:
1) *graph embeddings*, where the geometry of the embedding,
(e.g., Euclidean, spherical, or hyperbolic) heavily influences the
accuracy and distortion of the embedding;
2) *dynamical systems*, where the geometry of the state space can uncover
unobserved properties of the underlying systems, e.g.,
geographic information such as obstacles or terrains; and
3) *regression*, where the geometry of the prediction space
influences where the model should be accurate or inaccurate
for some downstream task.
We will focus on /latent/ geometries in these settings that are
not directly observable from the data, i.e., the geometry cannot
be estimated as a submanifold of the Euclidean space the data
is observed in.
Instead, the geometry can be shaped via a downstream
signal that propagates through differentiable operations such as
the geodesic distance, and log/exp maps on Riemannian manifolds.
The talk covers the foundational tools here on making operations
differentiable (in general via the envelope and implicit function theorems,
and simpler when closed-form operations are available),
and demonstrates where the end-to-end learned geometry is effective."

      abstract: "With the revolution of machine learning technologies in recent years, AI and data science are holding greater promise in understanding diseases and improving quality of care. Computational health is such a research area aiming at developing computational methodologies for deriving insights from various biomedical data. Currently the research in computational health has been mostly siloed, with different communities focusing on analyzing different types of data. However, human health has its own ecosystem with information from all aspects including genome, phenome and exposome. We need to integrate the insights from all of them to have more holistic understandings of diseases. In this talk, I will present the research from my lab health in recent years on building machine learning models for analyzing different types of data involved in different levels of human life science, and the need for transitioning from conventional focused-community based strategy to a holistic full-stack regime for the next-generation health AI/data science research."

      abstract: "Interactions between proteins form the basis for many biological processes, and understanding their relationships is an area of active research. Computational approaches offer a way to facilitate this understanding without the burden of expensive and time-consuming experiments. Here, we introduce LATENTDOCK, a generative model for protein-protein docking. Our method leverages a diffusion model operating within a geometrically-structured latent space, derived from an encoder producing roto-translational invariant representations of protein complexes. Critically, it is able to perform flexible docking, capturing both backbone and side-chain conformational changes. Furthermore, our model can condition on binding sites, leading to significant performance gains. Empirical evaluations show the efficacy of our approach over relevant baselines, even outperforming models that do not account for flexibility."

      abstract: "Protein design appears to be an ideal application of geometric deep learning, with well-motivated symmetries and inductive biases from physics and structural biology. Indeed, until recently in silico protein design was completely dominated by hand-crafted structural models. Recent successes with sequence models are challenging this paradigm, but many researchers still believe strong geometric inductive biases are essential for generalization in data-scarce regimes. We will review a pragmatic assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of structural and sequence-based methods, and discuss the greatest opportunities and challenges facing structural methods in particular in contemporary protein design problems."

Additionally, it has an important application in causal inference in the context of observational studies: it can enable the identification of valid adjustment sets (VAS) for unbiased effect estimation. In this talk, I will introduce graphical models as well as some classical constraint-based causal discovery algorithms. We will see how these methods are notoriously expensive in the nonparametric setting, with exponential time and sample complexity in the worst case. Finally, I will introduce our recent work Local Discovery by Partitioning, a local causal discovery method that is tailored towards VAS identification."

      photo: "/img/me.jpg"
      abstract: "Most existing graph transformers typically capture distances between graph nodes and do not
take edge direction into account. This is a limiting assumption since many graph applications
need to exploit sophisticated relationships in graph data, such as time, causality, or generic
dependency constraints. We introduce a novel graph transformer architecture that explicitly
takes into account the directionality between connected graph nodes. To achieve this, we make
use of dual encodings to represent both potential roles, i.e., source or target, of each pair
of vertices linked by a directed edge. These encodings are learned by leveraging the latent
adjacency information extracted from a directional attention module, localized with $k$-hop
neighborhood information. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real graph datasets show that
our approach can lead to accuracy gains. We also discuss an exploration in mapping directed
graph transformers to quantum computers."

However, human health has its own ecosystem with information from all aspects including genome, phenome and exposome. We need to integrate the insights from all of them to have more holistic understandings of diseases. In this talk, I will present the research from my lab health in recent years on building machine learning models for analyzing different types of data involved in different levels of human life science, and the need for transitioning from conventional focused-community based strategy to a holistic full-stack regime for the next-generation health AI/data science research."
