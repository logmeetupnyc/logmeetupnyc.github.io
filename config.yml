      photo: "/img/jie.jpg"
      abstract: "The notion of curvature describes how spaces are bent at each point and Ricci flow deforms the space such that curvature changes in a way analogous to the diffusion of heat. In this talk I will discuss some of our work on discrete Ollivier Ricci curvature defined on graphs. Discrete curvature defined on an edge captures the local connectivity in the neighborhood. In general edges within a densely connected community have positive curvature while edges connecting different communities have negative curvature. By deforming edge weights with respect to curvature one can derive a Ricci flow metric which is robust to edge insertion/deletion. I will present applications of graph Ricci flow in graph analysis and learning, including network alignment, community detection and graph neural networks."

      abstract: "Cosmology is a branch of astrophysics dedicated to the study of the laws and constituents of the Universe. To achieve this, cosmologists look at the spatial distribution of galaxies in the Universe with the goal of finding patterns in that distribution that reveal the fundamental physics behind the dynamics of the cosmos. In this talk, I will show how deep learning is revolutionizing the way cosmologists tackle decades-old problems and how graph neural networks can be used in combination with state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations to maximize the amount of information that can be extracted from cosmological observations."
      bio: "Francisco (Paco) Villaescusa-Navarro is a research scientist at the Flatiron Institute in New York City. He did his PhD at the University of Valencia in Spain. He held postdoctoral positions at the Astronomical Observatory of Trieste, Italy, and the Center for Computational Astrophysics in New York before becoming an associate research scholar at Princeton University, where he holds a visiting research scholar position. Paco is the main architect of the Quijote simulations, the largest suite of cosmological N-body simulations ever run. He is also part of the CAMELS core team that designed and ran the largest set of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations to date. Paco combines the output of numerical simulations with machine learning methods to develop theoretical models to extract the maximum amount of information from cosmological surveys in order to unveil the Universe’s mysteries."

      photo: "/img/matt.jpg"
      abstract: "Interactions between proteins form the basis for many biological processes, and understanding their relationships is an area of active research. Computational approaches offer a way to facilitate this understanding without the burden of expensive and time-consuming experiments. Here, we introduce LATENTDOCK, a generative model for protein-protein docking. Our method leverages a diffusion model operating within a geometrically-structured latent space, derived from an encoder producing roto-translational invariant representations of protein complexes. Critically, it is able to perform flexible docking, capturing both backbone and side-chain conformational changes. Furthermore, our model can condition on binding sites, leading to significant performance gains. Empirical evaluations show the efficacy of our approach over relevant baselines, even outperforming models that do not account for flexibility."

      photo: "/img/samuel.jpg"
      abstract: "Protein design appears to be an ideal application of geometric deep learning, with well-motivated symmetries and inductive biases from physics and structural biology. Indeed, until recently in silico protein design was completely dominated by hand-crafted structural models. Recent successes with sequence models are challenging this paradigm, but many researchers still believe strong geometric inductive biases are essential for generalization in data-scarce regimes. We will review a pragmatic assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of structural and sequence-based methods, and discuss the greatest opportunities and challenges facing structural methods in particular in contemporary protein design problems."
