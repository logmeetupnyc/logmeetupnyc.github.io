<p itemprop="description"> Official page of the New York meetup of the <a href=https://logconference.org/ target="_blank">Learning on Graphs Conference</a>, an annual research conference that covers areas broadly related to machine learning on graphs and geometry. </p>

<p>The event serves as a local branch of the main conference, providing an environment for researchers in this field to convene and foster discussion and social connections. </p>

<p>The main objective of this event is to build and embrace an open and diverse community in the greater NYC area with students, professors, industry researchers working on/interested in both (machine) learning and graphs (computer science, discrete math, operation research, etc.), geometry (applied math, physics, neuroscience, biology, etc.), and networks (network science, social science, etc.)</p>
